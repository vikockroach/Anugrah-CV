  <p><em>Greetings! I am the <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">owner of Sesamie Noodle Shop</strong>.
    <p>I am also passionate in the field of <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);"> writing, social media, and programming</strong>.
  <p>I spent my free time <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">reading books, questioning things, writing, and taking photos</strong>.</em></p></td>

    <h3 style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">About</h3>
    <p>I have two main aims in life:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Honing as many skills I want as to become king of all trades</li>
      <li>Create things that contribute to solving social problems in Indonesia</li>
    </ol>
    <P>There’s this assumption that you have to focus on something that is linear to your ‘path’.
    But what is a path other than a different way of saying a branch.
    The consequence is that I’m hungry to learn.
    And it shaped my mindset to regard almost everything has a core and connections, that it is T-shaped and people are collaborative in nature.</p>

    <p>This kind of mentality drove me to discover things:
      <ul>
        <li>From <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">qualitative research</strong> to <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">creative</strong>.</li>
        <li>From <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">desk researching</strong> to <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">cooking</strong>.</li>
        <li>From <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">writing</strong> to <strong style="color:RGB(139,0,0);">photography</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>But the most important thing, unfamiliar territory doesn’t frighten me.
      During my college days,
      it was leading an organization and publishing, presenting research in front of international audiences.
      As a Community Manager it was social media alongside clear, concise, and impactful writing, project management, and creative.
      As a business owner it was cooking, marketing and advertising, and photography and videography.
      </p>
<p>But learning needs a rigorous training and supportive environment and your company is an agile and fast-paced company that can be the right place for me to grow and contribute. Let’s nurture each other!
